## Abstract

There is a growing need in the job market for professionals with data skills, including data literacy, data cleaning, and data modeling. Institutions are offering newer data science degrees and courses and many other STEM disciplines are revising curricula to adapt to the data science needs of the 21st century. Despite the growth in the data science industry, tech companies lack gender and racial diversity and people with disabilities disproportionately are underemployed in the industry.  The lack of diversity in the field leads to tech products that reinforce gender and racial bias and that provide limited access to people with disabilities. Thus, it is a national urgency to design accessible and inclusive data-intensive courses to prepare a future data workforce that is diverse.  
 
While we aim to create a diverse data science workforce, we must also aim to create a workforce that has an explicit understanding of accessibility and inclusion in data science. Data-intensive courses need to be taught accessibly to recruit diverse students to the field and data-intensive courses need to teach accessibility for the future data science workplace and products to be accessible and inclusive. In this presentation, I will share a framework for designing accessible and inclusive teaching materials for data-intensive courses designed for a diverse student body. This framework can be adopted in many data-intensive STEM fields. In addition, I will share curricular examples of teaching accessibility to students explicitly and early on in their undergraduate careers.
