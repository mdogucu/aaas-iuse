## Some statistics from tech world

- Only 4.8 % of technical roles are held by Hispanic employees, 2.4 % by Black employees and 25.8 % by women at Meta (2022)

- Of Google’s technical roles in the US, 1.2 % are held by Black women, 1.3 % by Latina women, and 0.2 % by Native American women (2023)

- Only 6.5% of Google’s global employees(technical and nontechnical) report having a disability, whereas World Health Organization estimates that 16% of the world's population experience significant disability (2023).

## Some Problems with Tech Tools

- Statistical translation tools (e.g., Google Translate) yield male pronoun defaults more frequently (Prates et al., 2019).
- Facial recognition algorithms are much less accurate in identifying women than men, and darker-skinned people than lighter-skinned people(Raji and Buolamwini, 2019). 
- Autonomous vehicles fail to recognize behaviors of people with disabilities (Disability Rights UK, 2021).

# We must design accessible and inclusive data-intensive courses to prepare a future data workforce that is diverse.

## Open-Access

- Cost of books and supplies for a student at a four-year university in 2021 was estimated to be $1240 per year ([Hanson, 2021](https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-college-textbooks)). 


- About 11% of the students indicated that they skipped meals in order to afford books and course materials ([Hanson, 2021](https://educationdata.org/average-cost-of-college-textbooks)).

- The bayesrulesbook.com page has been accessed from more than 150 countries.

## Assistive Technology

Assistive Technology is any form of technology (software, device) that helps people with disabilities perform certain activities. 

Examples:

- walking sticks
- wheel chairs
- screen readers


## Screen reader


A screen reader is an assistive technology that supports blind or visually impaired people in using their computer.

The video shows use of a screen reader briefly. 

</div>

## Alternate Text

- "Alt text" describes contents of an image. 
- It is used in HTML pages. 
- Screen-readers cannot read images but can read alt text. 
- Alt text has to be provided. 

##

#| out-width: 100%

```


## Making math accessible

- Should calculus be a prerequisite?
- Checking intuition with active learning quizzes.
- Supporting mathematical concepts with computing.

## Making learning fun 


> How can we live if we don’t change? 
—Beyoncé. Lyric from “Satellites.”

vs.

. . .

> What is probability?

## Embracing mistakes as part of learning

> As you read the book and put Bayesian methodology into practice, you will make mistakes. Many mistakes. Making and learning from mistakes is simply part of learning. We hope that you persist through the struggle of learning so that you can contribute your unique insights, perspectives, and experiences to the Bayesian community.

v.s.

> The proof is obvious.

# Making learning relevant with diverse set of applications

- Penguins

## Curriculum Goal

As educators, we have to ensure that the current and the next generation of data scientists, provide public-facing outputs (websites, analysis reports, etc.) that are accessible.

## Learning Objectives

- Students should get familiar with Americans with Disabilities Act and/or United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
- Students should use at least one assistive technology (i.e. screen reader).
- Students should consider different representations of data.


## Students can use screen reader on Windows and Mac

- If you are on a Windows machine go to Settings > Ease of Access > Narrator, and then turn on the toggle under Use Narrator.

- If you are on a Mac go to System Preferences > Accessibility > Voice Over > Enable Voice Over

[Color Blindness Simulator](https://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) You can upload any image and in return get an image with colors that would be visible to color-blind people with specific color vision deficiency.

## Data Verbalization


We can verbalize data via alternate text.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-alt: The scatterplot shows speed ranging from about 0 to 25 mph on the x-axis and dist ranging from 0 to 120 ft on the y-axis. There is a moderate positive linear relationship.
#| fig-cap: The speed of cars (mph) and the distances (ft) taken to stop
#| fig-height: 4
plot(cars, cex.lab=1.5, cex.axis=1.5, cex.main=1.5, cex.sub=1.5)
```


## 

```{r}
#| echo: fenced
#| fig-cap: "The speed of cars (mph) and the distances (ft) taken to stop"
#| fig-alt: "The scatterplot shows speed ranging from about 0 to 25 mph on the x-axis and dist ranging from 0 to 120 ft on the y-axis. There is a moderate positive linear relationship."
plot(cars)
```


## Manual Alternate Text

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Chart type

- Type of data

- Reason for including the chart

- Link to data or source (not in alt text but in main text)

[Cesal, 2020](https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Description conveys meaning in the data

- Variables included on the axes

- Scale described within the description

- Type of plot is described

## Alternate Texts are Under Utilized in the Data Science Community

"Over the 3 years of TidyTuesday, there were 7,136 data viz tweets and only 215 (3%) of them had alt-text"

## Data Sonification

Data sonification is the presentation of data as sound. 

```{r}
#| echo: false

#| fig-height: 3
x <- 1:10
y <- 1:10
plot(x, y)

## Data Tactualization

Data tactulization refers to making data visualization in a form so that it can be touchable.

Different representations of data is one way of introducing accessibility to students but it is not meant to be a complete introduction to accessibility.
